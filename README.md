# MovieMuse
MovieMuse is a content based movie recommender system using Machine Learning.This project aims to suggest personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and historical data. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms and techniques to analyze user behavior, movie attributes, and patterns in order to generate accurate and relevant movie recommendations.

The recommender system typically involves the following steps:

1.Data collection: Gathering movie data, user ratings, and other relevant information such as genre, director, cast, and user preferences.

2.Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the collected data into a suitable format for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.

3.Feature extraction: Extracting relevant features from the available data, such as movie attributes and user preferences, to create a representation that captures the essence of each movie and user.

4.Model training: Using machine learning algorithms, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches, to train a model on the preprocessed data. The model learns patterns and relationships between movies and users based on historical data.

5.Recommendation generation: Leveraging the trained model to generate movie recommendations for users. This involves predicting the likelihood of a user liking a particular movie based on their historical behavior and the characteristics of the movie.


TMDB DATASETS are used for DATA COLLECTION

Python libraries like numpy,pandas,sklearn,pickle,etc  are used
